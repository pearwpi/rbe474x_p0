    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will learn how to segment objects or classes based on their color properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will perform color segmentation to identify and classify the following objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class 0**: Green cap (Smallest one)\n",
    "- **Class 1**: Yellow cap\n",
    "- **Class 2**: Blue cap\n",
    "- **Class 3**: Red cap (Largest one)\n",
    "\n",
    "A sample output is provided below. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Blue Cap](./artefacts/sample.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You are provided with 7 RGB images containing 4 distinct classes of objects. Your task is to perform color segmentation using Gaussian models that represent the probability distribution of each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "Include a 7x5 image grid in your report. Each row should correspond to one of the original images and its respective segmentation results, where a mask is applied to highlight the identified objects. Refer to the sample output for the expected format.\n",

    "### RGB Color Space\n",
    "\n",
    "RGB stands for Red, Green, and Blue‚Äîthe primary colors of light. In the RGB color space, colors are represented as combinations of these three colors, each with varying intensities. Each color component (R, G, B) typically ranges from 0 to 255 in digital images.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Red**: Controls the intensity of the red color in the pixel.\n",
    "- **Green**: Controls the intensity of the green color.\n",
    "- **Blue**: Controls the intensity of the blue color.\n",
    "\n",
    "By mixing different levels of these three colors, a wide range of colors can be created. For example, pure red is represented as (255, 0, 0), while white is (255, 255, 255), and black is (0, 0, 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "RGB is the most common color space used in digital imaging, displays, and cameras. It's the basis for how colors are displayed on screens, where each pixel is made up of tiny red, green, and blue subpixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Color Segmentation using a Single Gaussian\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you'll explore how to segment objects in images based on their color using a probabilistic approach. Instead of simply stating that a pixel is a certain color (like red or green), you'll learn how to assign probabilities to each color. This method is more accurate in real-world scenarios where sensor noise and lighting conditions can cause color variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We approach color classification as a machine learning problem, where each pixel is assigned a probability of belonging to a specific color class (e.g., the likelihood that a pixel is part of a green cap). Essentially, given a pixel's color (R, G, B), we estimate the probability that it belongs to a particular class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a class, we can estimate the spread of the RGB values (probability distribution) by analyzing the dataset. However, to estimate the probability that a particular RGB value belongs to a certain class, we use Bayes' rule to solve this problem. Mathematically, \n",

    "If we're trying to segment out an orange fruit, we start by understanding the typical range of RGB values for the color orange. We also take into account any prior information. For example, if we know the image was taken on Mars, the chance of finding an orange fruit is practically zero. Thus, even if the color suggests otherwise, we can conclude that the object is not an orange fruit.\n",

    "1. In the provided training images (found in the data folder), the probability of finding each of the four classes is assumed to be equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We also apply a confidence threshold to classify a pixel. If the probability of a pixel being part of the range fruit, given its RGB value, is higher than a set threshold (e.g., 0.01), we can confidently classify that pixel as belonging to the orange fruit. \n",
